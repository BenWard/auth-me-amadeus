This is a simple tool to take a user through the OAuth process on provision
of an Application Consumer Key *and* and Application Secret. They are taken
through the OAuth flow, and come out with an authed user token.

You need to add in the Fire Eagle PHP wrapper from
http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/developer and needs an immediate rewrite to take 
logic out of the frontend, but hey, if you need to quickly throw together an 
OAuth debugging front-end for your app, this might help. Should be easily 
adaptable for any OAuth API.
